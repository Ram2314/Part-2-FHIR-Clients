# FHIR for Medical Students 
# Part: 2 FHIR Clients

## Overview

Welcome to Part 2 of our FHIR Clients lesson series. In this section, we will delve deeper into creating and managing FHIR resources programmatically using the SMART on FHIR client library. This hands-on experience is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of connecting to a FHIR server, creating resources, and handling server responses.

## Introduction

### What is FHIR?

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It aims to simplify implementation without sacrificing information integrity. FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components called "Resources," which can be easily assembled into working systems to address real-world clinical and administrative needs.

### What is a FHIR Client?

A FHIR client is a software application that interacts with FHIR servers to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) FHIR resources. The SMART on FHIR client library provides a robust framework for building such applications, enabling seamless communication with FHIR servers and simplifying the integration of healthcare data.

### Why Use FHIR Clients?

Using FHIR clients allows developers to:
- Efficiently manage healthcare data through standardized APIs.
- Integrate and interoperate with various healthcare systems.
- Enhance data exchange capabilities in healthcare applications.
- Leverage existing healthcare data to build innovative solutions.

### Objectives of This Lesson

In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- Establish a connection to a FHIR server.
- Create and manage FHIR resources programmatically.
- Handle server responses to ensure successful operations.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the SMART on FHIR client library to interact with FHIR servers and manage healthcare data effectively.
